```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Load libraries

library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
billboard = read.csv("billboard.csv")

```

# Wrangling the Billboard Top 100
## Part A
```{r, echo=FALSE}
top_songs <- billboard %>%
  group_by(performer, song) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%  # Summarise and drop groups for proper sorting
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%  # Sort by count in descending order
  slice(1:10)  # Select the top 10 songs
top_songs
```
The above table shows the top 10 most popular songs from 1958 to 2021 (2021 is not fully up-to-date) based on the total number of weeks that a song spent on the Billboard Top 100. Interestingly, no artist shares more than 1 song in the top 10.

## Part B
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Step 1: Filter the data to exclude years 1958 and 2021
filtered_data <- billboard %>%
  filter(year > 1958 & year < 2021)

# Step 2: Group by year and song, and count unique songs
diversity_per_year <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(year, song) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(unique_songs = n())

# Step 3: Plot the data
diversity_plot <- ggplot(diversity_per_year, aes(x = year, y = unique_songs)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Musical Diversity on the Billboard Top 100 (1959-2020)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Unique Songs",
       caption = "This line graph shows the number of unique songs that appeared on the Billboard Top
       100 in each year from 1959 to 2020. An interesting trend I noticed is the historical low in
       the diversity from 1990 to 2005ish, with a stark increase from around 2015.") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the plot
print(diversity_plot)

```

## Part C

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Step 1: Identify songs that were on the Billboard Top 100 for at least 10 weeks
ten_week_hits <- billboard %>%
  group_by(performer, song) %>%
  summarise(weeks_on_chart = n()) %>%
  filter(weeks_on_chart >= 10)

# Step 2: Count the number of ten-week hits per artist
artist_hits <- ten_week_hits %>%
  group_by(performer) %>%
  summarise(ten_week_hits_count = n()) %>%
  filter(ten_week_hits_count >= 30)

# Step 3: Create a bar plot
# Optional: Reorder the artists by the number of ten-week hits
artist_hits <- artist_hits %>%
  arrange(desc(ten_week_hits_count))

# Plotting
hits_plot <- ggplot(artist_hits, aes(x = fct_reorder(performer, ten_week_hits_count), y = ten_week_hits_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  coord_flip() +  # Flip coordinates for better readability
  labs(title = "Number of Ten-Week Hits for Top 19 Artists",
       x = "Artist",
       y = "Number of Ten-Week Hits",
       caption = "Figure: This bar plot shows the number of ten-week hits (songs that appeared on the
       Billboard Top 100 for at least ten weeks) for the top 19 artists who had 30 or more such hits
       in their career. As expected, pop artists dominate the charts, but interestingly, some country artists are top artists as well.") +
  theme_minimal()
